# Rust :crab:. How do I start?

A collaborative advice for this casual questions that gets asked many times, so here it is as a Github repo anyone can contribute to and improve!

## Mainstream

1. The [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/). You can read it cover to cover, or skim it. What ever you do, make sure you have a pet project idea to experiment with. You can pick [any of the core utils you like](https://github.com/uutils/coreutils/tree/main/src/uu). The advantage of just re-implementing a core util is that you are probably familiar with one of those, they're just CLI apps and you're not biting more than you can chew, and you do have the source code in that repo for reference.
2. Pick a hobby project, something more than trivial that includes data passing and a few modules (just so you get to experience the borrow checker and data modeling) something in the scope of [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat/tree/master/src). Work on it and read the Rust book. Repeat, rinse.
3. You're now ready for [Rust by example](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-by-example) and [Rust by practice](https://github.com/sunface/rust-by-practice)
4. When you feel curious about the "why's", pick up [Rust for Rustaceans](https://nostarch.com/rust-rustaceans). This is the point where you're moving from beginner to intermediate Rust developer.
5. Next, [Zero to Production in Rust](https://www.zero2prod.com/) will give you some service-ish, production-ish use cases which will round off your experience

From here, since everyone have their own taste, visit [Rust Books](https://lborb.github.io/book/) from time to time to pick up a resource that you feel can move you forward to the next step.


## Contributing

Please feel free to submit PRs to improve this list. A few pointers:

1. The list must be concise
2. If there are new tracks, feel free to open them by adding a new subtitle to this README and submit PR (i.e. "Rust for game developers, how do I start?")

Happy hacking!
